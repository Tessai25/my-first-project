Phishing Attack Analysis and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

1. Identifying the Phishing Attack Type

Phishing attacks can take various forms, including:
	•	Email Phishing – Fraudulent emails impersonating legitimate entities.
	•	Spear Phishing – Targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals or organizations.
	•	Whaling – Attacks directed at high-profile executives or officials.
	•	Smishing (SMS Phishing) – Phishing attempts via text messages.
	•	Vishing (Voice Phishing) – Social engineering conducted over the phone.
	•	Clone Phishing – Duplication of a legitimate email with malicious links or attachments.

2. Collecting Evidence

To analyze a phishing attack, gather the following:
	•	Email headers and metadata
	•	Suspicious URLs or domains
	•	Attachments or downloaded files
	•	System logs and network traffic
	•	Reports of user account compromise

3. Key Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

Email-Based IoCs
	•	Suspicious sender addresses with minor typos or impersonation (e.g., support@paypa1.com instead of support@paypal.com)
	•	Mismatched display name and sender domain
	•	Urgent language requesting immediate action
	•	Unexpected attachments with suspicious file extensions (.exe, .zip, .docm)
	•	Links leading to fraudulent login pages

Website-Based IoCs
	•	Non-secure HTTP instead of HTTPS
	•	Domains mimicking legitimate sites (e.g., faccebook.com instead of facebook.com)
	•	Requests for sensitive credentials or financial details
	•	Poorly designed interfaces with spelling errors

System-Based IoCs
	•	Unusual network traffic connecting to unknown IPs
	•	Execution of unauthorized software or scripts
	•	Unexpected login attempts from unknown locations
	•	Changes to system security settings, such as disabled antivirus or firewall
	•	Unauthorized access to sensitive files or databases

4. Investigative Tools and Techniques
	•	Email header analysis: Use MXToolbox or built-in email client tools
	•	URL inspection: Use VirusTotal or URLScan.io to check for malicious links
	•	Attachment scanning: Analyze suspicious files with Windows Defender, Malwarebytes, or Hybrid Analysis
	•	Network monitoring: Check logs with Wireshark or Splunk for unusual activity

5. Mitigation and Response
	•	Report the phishing email to the IT security team or email provider
	•	Block the malicious sender domain in the email security gateway
	•	Reset compromised credentials and enforce multi-factor authentication
	•	Monitor affected systems for unusual activity
	•	Educate users on phishing awareness and prevention measures

A thorough analysis of phishing incidents helps in identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening cybersecurity defenses.
